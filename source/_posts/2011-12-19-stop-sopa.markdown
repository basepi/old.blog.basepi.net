I've heard a lot of chatter about SOPA (the Stop Online Privacy Act), which is
currently going through congress.  However, today I finally decided to look
into it.  And I definitely didn't like what I found.  Here's a video summing up
the problems (the video is for the Protect IP act, which was introduced earlier
this year, but most of the same problems apply to both bills).  (Found via
[Matt Cutt's Blog][1]

Watch the video.  Then Google "SOPA" for more information.  You can also sign a
petition against the act [here][2].  Visit [Matt Cutt's Blog Post][1] for some
more links to information and ways you can get involved.  Join with me and so
many others in speaking out against SOPA!
