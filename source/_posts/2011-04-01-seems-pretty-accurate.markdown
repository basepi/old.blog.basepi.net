I had to laugh a little.  After I deleted the default post in the new WordPress
installation that was to be my blog, this is what the site looked like:

(Sorry, but I actually lost this image in my blogging platform switch.
Whoops!)

If you can't read it, it says, "Not Found.  Sorry, but you're looking for
something that isn't here."  Seems pretty accurate.

It just kind of struck me as funny.  Those of you who have known me for awhile
know that I've started a couple of blogs in my time.  None of them have stuck
for very long.  Maybe this one will, who knows?  But still, I can't help but
laugh at the potential accuracy of that screenshot.

Anyway, welcome to my new blog.  Here will (theoretically) go all the boring
details of my boring life.  I hope you enjoy.  More to come.
