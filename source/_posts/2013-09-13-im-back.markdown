Well, at long last I got around to re-installing Ruby on my machine, updated
Octopress, and got my blogs settles.  I'm back!

So what's been going on in the interim?  Let's hit the top two:

- I graduated Magna Cum Laude from the University of Utah with a BS in Computer
  Science.
- I switched jobs -- I now work for Salt Stack, Inc, making awesome open source
  software.

A lot has changed, and I hope to have much more to blog about now that I'm more
involved in the open source community.  Feel free to throw me feedback!  I
don't pretend to be an awesome blogger.  =)
