It's road shows!!!
------------------

I'm waiting in the wings with the rest of the River Park Ward crew, waiting
patiently for our turn to perform.  Tonight are the South Jordan River Stake
Road Shows!

Here's the idea:  each ward has 15 minutes to put on a show.  We were given a
theme, only a few weeks to prepare, and very little budget.  It's not meant to
be a professional affair -- it's just good fun!  The other twist is that we have
to be mobile -- we're performing at 3 different locations this evening, and only
have a few minutes to get between places and set up and tear down our props and
so forth.  Kind of fun.  =)  The people in our ward who wrote the script did a
really good job, and...now we're on, I'll continue this later.

We're done with all the performances now, and they went really well.  The theme
of the road show was "Put your shoulder to the \_\_\_\_\_\_".  Our
implementation of that theme was "Put your shoulder to the Deal or No Deal".
Basically, we did "Deal or No Deal:  Dating Edition".  Our male lead, Neal, was
searching for his eternal companion (or "EC"), and each case he opened was another
date.  It didn't stick to the Deal or No Deal rules almost at all, but was still
very well written and pretty funny.  Everything went off generally without a
hitch.  I think it turned out really well!

Oh, and if you're wondering, no, I wasn't in the cast.  I was the soundboard
guy, running all the sound effects.  It actually was pretty fun!
