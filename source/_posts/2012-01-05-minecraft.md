I finally did it.  I broke down and rented a Minecraft server.

Previously, I had hosted a Minecraft server pretty successfully on my personal
web server.  The problem became two-fold:  it was a huge time-sink, as updating
all the plugins that I was running took a long time at each release.  Also,
while hosting the Minecraft server, my server would often become unresponsive,
requiring a restart.  This was unacceptable, as I also host a Teamspeak 3
server, an IRC bouncer, and multiple websites from my server.  I needed maximum
uptime!  So I finally shut down my Minecraft server for good.

But now it's back!  OK, it's not the exact same server -- I didn't bring the
old world over.  I wanted a fresh start.  But it's a Minecraft server, and it's
all mine for the building!  OK, not all mine:  I want you to come too!  If you
already have a Minecraft account, post it in the comments so I can add you to
the user list.  (Otherwise you won't be able to build)  If you've never played
Minecraft, head on over to [minecraft.net][1] and buy the game.  Just do it,
it's worth it.

My server is at mc.basepi.net.  Come and join us in building something awesome!
