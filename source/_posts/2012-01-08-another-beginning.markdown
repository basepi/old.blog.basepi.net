School starts again tomorrow.  OK, well, I actually don't have classes until
Tuesday, but the semester officially starts.

It should be an interesting semester.  I only have one in-person class, and 3
online courses.  I'm getting a bunch of my general ed out of the way this
semester, which is exciting.  Sure, technical classes are more difficult, but
since I'm interested in them, they're not as bad for me.

Anyway, I'm going to try to blog, even in short spurts like this one,
throughout this semester.  We'll see how I do!

Wish me luck!
