The interesting thing is that that title is not true.  But it's still how I'm
feeling -- I'm finished with the final projects for both CS4962 (Mobile
Programming) and CS3505 (Software Practice 2), as well as my algorithms (CS4150)
final.  With only Physics left, I might as well be done, 'cause the stress is so
much less!  It's glorious indeed.

But, since I'm not *actually* done with finals, I suppose I should get back to
it, rather than sit here pretending I can write.  Until next time....
