Here we go again.
-----------------

I mean, seriously.  You've gotta be wondering, "Why does he even keep trying?"
This has to be my 6th or 7th attempt at a blog.  Shouldn't I just give up
already?

Well this time I'm trying something a little bit different.  I'm going to blog
about technology, rather than my personal life.  Obviously I'll try to throw
some personal life stuff in there, but the problem is, I don't feel like my life
is interesting to write about, and thus I have a hard time staying interested in
the writing, and I assume others have a hard time staying interested in the
reading.  Those of you who aren't "techies" out there, I hope you'll still come
read a little.  I think you'll find some interesting stuff.  And who knows, if I
can keep up interest in a tech blog, maybe I'll be able to make and keep a
personal blog too.

More to come.  I'm going to post a little on the reasoning behind this post a
little later.
