OK, this blog post may be premature.  But with school looming in just a few
short weeks (1 day less than three weeks, to be exact), it sure feels like
summer is coming to a close.  Now I should maybe clarify:  I do not care that
summer as a season is coming to a close.  It's quite frankly too hot, and I
much prefer fall, spring, or even, dare I say it, winter.  But I'm definitely
sad my break is ending.  Why, you might ask?  Well, even if you didn't ask and
don't want to know, I'll tell you.  Feel free to post TL:DR and get the heck
out.  ;-)

The first and foremost reason I'm bummed school is starting is the homework.
Sure, I've been working full time this summer, and as such have been
"busy"....but it's a different kind of busy.  When I go home from work, work
stays at work.  However, school always comes home with me, in the form of
homework.  Some homework isn't even too bad, and a few assignments can actually
be pretty fun, but with one of my classes being a writing class, I have little
hope for a good chunk of my homework.  Ah well, life goes on.

The writing class I mentioned actually is the whole of the second reason I
don't want to go back to school:  boring, stupid, ridiculous classes.  I don't
deny that writing is an important skill, but the path to gaining that skill is
a long, boring one.  Ugh.

However, on the bright side (yes, there's definitely a bright side), I'm also
taking some classes about which I'm pretty excited!  Computer
Systems promises to be a very interesting class, despite its reputation as
being a fairly difficult class.  I'm also taking Engineering Probability and
Statistics (which doesn't sound half bad to me, but then again I'm weird), as
well as Models of Computation (about which I'm pretty excited).  All in all
it's shaping up to be a good semester, I think, especially since I feel I've
recovered nicely from the burnout of last semester.  One can only hope that
feeling lasts.  =)

In the meantime, we still have a fun family camping trip coming up this next
weekend, and then I'll have a week and a half of relative freedom remaining
before school starts....I guess I need to go see when I can buy my new parking
permit.  And the list begins!  =\
