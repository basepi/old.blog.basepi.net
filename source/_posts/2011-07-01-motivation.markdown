What motivates us?

I've pondered that question a fair bit lately, as I've struggled to motivate
myself to take on one project or another.  On the one hand, it's summer, and
after four straight semesters of full classloads, I feel like I should have a
break.  At the same time, though, I like to feel like I'm doing something, plus
I really enjoy programming.  Here's the problem, though:  every time I try to
pick up a new project, the motivation to work on it lasts a short while, and
then I move on to my next "fad".

My apparent attention deficit aside, once we start a large project, it's
difficult to keep at it, especially when the scope of such a project becomes
apparent.  I recently read [a post][1] by [Nick O'Neill][2] which addresses
this difficulty, and a really insightful solution:

> When you start an ambitious project you're excited because of the journey that
> you're embarking on. Months in, you'll probably be cursing at yourself for
> taking on a project that's so ambitious.
>
> At those moments where you're cursing yourself or feeling like you may have
> taken on something that's too challenging, it's helpful to have someone there
> to say 'keep at it'! Whoever that may be, make sure you assign someone even if
> you don't have a significant other to help you out. It could be one of your
> parents, a good friend, or anybody else.
>
> Starting off with a long-term vision makes it way too easy to quit early on.
> Break up the project into chunks and then set reasonable goals. Eventually
> you'll create your vision

I'm going to work on taking Mr. O'Neill's advice, and getting others to help me
keep my goals.  You should too!

Have any insights into staying motivated?  Please leave a comment below!  =)
