Computers.

I got pulled in at a pretty young age.  First it was the computer games -- _Lode
Runner_ on our black-and-white Macintosh; later, _Warcraft 2_ on our 486.  It
just escalated from there.  I still play a lot of video games (my parents will
tell you that I play way too much, and they're probably right), but the less...
flashy end of computing pulled me in, slowly but surely, as time went on.

My Dad taught me some basic DOS commands as we installed Doom from about nine
floppies.  I learned how to install and uninstall programs, tweak the operating
system to gain more performance, mess with the registry enough to need a Windows
reinstallation... (not very hard, that last one -- but a rant on the Windows
registry should be a topic for another day)

I downloaded tool after tool, tinkering with different things.  I discovered the
editor wars (Vim vs. Emacs), and decided I wanted to take a side in that war.
(Vim, by the way.....it's where I'm editing this article right now!)  I
eventually took a large course in C# and Java my senior year in high school, and
that's when the fun really began.

My name is Colton Myers, and I'm currently attending the University of Utah to
get a degree in Computer Science.  I'm a nerd, and proud of it.

Along my journey I discovered a something:

*Nobody knows everything about computers.*  It's true.  There's just too much
for one person to know it all.  And so we rely on the millions of other nerds
out there who have a piece of the knowledge, and together we can do some pretty
spectacular things.

The point is, I don't claim to know everything.  In fact, I generally know just
enough to (1) be dangerous, and (2) have an idea of how much I do *not* know.
But I do know a few things, and hope to be able to share some of them.  I also
hope to be able to learn a few things in turn from you, the reader.  So please,
comment!  I love questions, and I'll do my best to find the answer for you, and
I love it when people give new ideas/tricks, or yes, even when they correct
errors in my knowledge.

So let's get to it!  =)
